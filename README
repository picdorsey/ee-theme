What the Theme?
===

This is forked from the Nerdery Theme.

The Nerdery did a great jon with their theme. I just wanted to make it better for my workflow.

Installation
============

1. Create a directory called "whatever" inside of /themes/cp_themes and place the contents this repo inside of it. You'll then have /themes/cp_themes/whatever/
2. Place $config['cp_theme'] = 'whatever'; into your config.php file to ensure all users receive this theme.
